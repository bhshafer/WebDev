    <dl>
        <dt>Ten</dt>
        <dd>This is Pearl Jam's first album and it has many great songs. "Alive" and "Jeremy" are my favorites from this album.</dd>
        
        <dt>Vs.</dt>
        <dd>This album has a heavier sound than Ten. The songs are more intense and the guitar work is really good.</dd>
